            { id: 1, product: 'UniFi', category: 'Wi-Fi', title: 'Clients Connect but Get No Internet', symptom: "Device connects to Wi-Fi, shows full signal, but has no internet access. May have a 169.254.x.x IP address.", cause: "DHCP server failure or exhausted IP address pool.", solution: "Navigate to **Settings > Networks > [Select Network]**. Check the 'DHCP Range'. If the range is too small for the number of clients, expand it. If the server is down, reboot the UniFi gateway or the server acting as the DHCP authority." },
            { id: 2, product: 'UniFi', category: 'Wi-Fi', title: 'Poor Wi-Fi Speeds Despite Strong Signal', symptom: "Slow speed tests and downloads despite a strong Wi-Fi signal.", cause: "Co-channel interference.", solution: "In the UniFi Controller, go to the **Devices** tab, select an Access Point, and go to its **Tools** tab. Run an **RF Scan**. Identify the least-congested channels for both 2.4GHz and 5GHz. Manually set the APs to use these channels in **Devices > [Select AP] > Settings > Radios**." },
            { id: 3, product: 'UniFi', category: 'Wi-Fi', title: '\"Sticky Clients\" Ruining Roaming', symptom: "A mobile device stays connected to a distant AP instead of roaming to a closer one.", cause: "Poorly configured roaming assistance.", solution: "Enable **Band Steering** to Prefer 5GHz under **Settings > Wi-Fi > [Your SSID] > Advanced**. More effectively, enable **Minimum RSSI** on individual APs (**Devices > [Select AP] > Settings > Radios**). Start with a low value like -75dBm and adjust as needed." },
            { id: 4, product: 'UniFi', category: 'Wi-Fi', title: 'Constant Wi-Fi Disconnections', symptom: "Devices randomly drop off the network.", cause: "Unstable power to the AP (check PoE), faulty network cable, or firmware bugs.", solution: "Swap the ethernet cable with a known good one. If using a PoE injector, try a different one. If connected to a PoE switch, try a different port. Check for firmware updates for the AP, as bug fixes often address stability." },
            { id: 5, product: 'UniFi', category: 'Wi-Fi', title: 'Certain Devices Refuse to Connect', symptom: "Older or IoT devices fail to connect.", cause: "Advanced features like **WPA3** or **PMF** are enabled, which the device doesn't support.", solution: "Create a new, dedicated SSID for these devices. Set its security to WPA2 and disable PMF (set to 'Disabled'). Alternatively, for the main network, you can use WPA2/WPA3 transition mode." },
            { id: 6, product: 'UniFi', category: 'Wi-Fi', title: 'Buffering on Streaming Services', symptom: "Video services constantly buffer.", cause: "High latency ('bufferbloat').", solution: "Navigate to **Settings > Internet > [Select WAN Network]**. Enable **Smart Queues**. The controller will run a speed test and set values automatically. This will limit maximum throughput slightly but dramatically improve latency." },
            { id: 7, product: 'UniFi', category: 'Wi-Fi', title: 'Inconsistent Coverage (Wi-Fi \"Dead Zones\")', symptom: "Areas with very weak or no Wi-Fi signal.", cause: "Poor AP placement, new physical obstructions, or incorrect AP transmit power settings.", solution: "Use a Wi-Fi analysis app to map signal strength. Adjust AP placement if possible. In the controller, set AP transmit power to 'Auto' or manually adjust to 'Medium' or 'High' to fill gaps. Consider adding another AP to the dead zone." },
            { id: 8, product: 'UniFi', category: 'Wi-Fi', title: 'Band Steering Not Working as Expected', symptom: "5GHz-capable clients remain on the congested 2.4GHz band.", cause: "The 2.4GHz radio's signal is too strong.", solution: "In **Devices > [Select AP] > Settings > Radios**, manually set the 2.4GHz radio power to 'Low' or 'Medium' and the 5GHz radio power to 'High'. This creates a signal strength incentive for clients to choose 5GHz." },
            { id: 9, product: 'UniFi', category: 'Wi-Fi', title: 'DFS Channel Delays', symptom: "An AP using a DFS channel is temporarily unavailable after a reboot or power outage.", cause: "This is normal behavior. The AP must scan for radar signals for 1-10 minutes before broadcasting on a DFS channel.", solution: "Be patient and inform users this is expected. If the delay is unacceptable for critical areas, manually set the AP to use a non-DFS channel (e.g., 36, 40, 44, 48, 149, 153, 157, 161)." },
            { id: 10, product: 'UniFi', category: 'Wi-Fi', title: 'Specific Client Driver Issues', symptom: "Devices with a particular Wi-Fi chipset have persistent connectivity issues.", cause: "Incompatibility with certain UniFi settings.", solution: "Check for updated Wi-Fi drivers from the client device's manufacturer (e.g., Dell, HP, Intel). As a workaround, create a separate SSID for these devices and disable high-performance features like BSS Transition, Fast Roaming, and PMF." },
            { id: 11, product: 'UniFi', category: 'Wi-Fi', title: 'RADIUS Authentication Failures', symptom: "Users cannot connect to an Enterprise SSID; the RADIUS server rejects authentication.", cause: "Mismatched shared secret, incorrect server IP, or firewall blocking RADIUS ports (1812/1813).", solution: "Double-check the shared secret on both the UniFi RADIUS profile and the RADIUS server. Verify the server's IP address is correct. Ensure any firewalls between the APs and the RADIUS server allow UDP traffic on ports 1812 and 1813." },
            { id: 12, product: 'UniFi', category: 'Wi-Fi', title: 'Wireless Meshing Instability', symptom: "A wirelessly meshed AP frequently disconnects or has extremely low throughput.", cause: "The AP is too far from its wired uplink, or there is significant interference between the two APs.", solution: "Move the meshed AP closer to its uplink AP. Check the signal strength in the controller; it should be better than -70dBm. Manually set the two APs to a clean, non-overlapping 5GHz channel to improve the wireless backhaul link." },
            { id: 13, product: 'UniFi', category: 'Wi-Fi', title: 'Client Isolation Not Working', symptom: "Devices on a guest network can see and interact with each other when they shouldn't.", cause: "The 'Client Isolation' feature is not enabled, or a downstream non-UniFi switch is not honoring the isolation.", solution: "In **Settings > Wi-Fi > [Your Guest SSID]**, enable **Client Isolation**. Ensure all devices are connected to UniFi switches, as this feature may not propagate correctly through third-party hardware." },
            { id: 14, product: 'UniFi', category: 'Controller', title: 'Controller is Offline/Unreachable', symptom: "Cannot access the UniFi management interface.", cause: "The hosting device (Cloud Key, UDM, server) has crashed, lost power, or lost network connectivity.", solution: "Check physical power and network connections to the host device. Attempt to ping its IP address. If it's a Cloud Key or UDM, a physical power cycle (unplug for 30 seconds) may be necessary." },
            { id: 15, product: 'UniFi', category: 'Controller', title: 'UniFi OS Console Storage is Full', symptom: "The management interface is extremely slow or crashes.", cause: "Internal storage is full from Protect recordings or network statistics.", solution: "In UniFi OS settings, configure data retention for Protect to automatically delete older footage. In the Network Application, go to **Settings > System > Maintenance** and compact the database. Prune older statistics if necessary." },
            { id: 16, product: 'UniFi', category: 'Controller', title: 'Configuration \"Stuck\" in a Provisioning Loop', symptom: "A device is stuck in a loop of 'Provisioning' and 'Adopting.'", cause: "Database corruption in the controller or a firmware mismatch.", solution: "Reboot the affected device. If that fails, reboot the UniFi controller. As a last resort, use the 'Forget' option for the device in the controller, factory reset the device using its physical reset button, and then re-adopt it." },
            { id: 17, product: 'UniFi', category: 'Controller', title: 'Remote Access (unifi.ui.com) is Down', symptom: "Cannot manage the site remotely via the cloud portal.", cause: "The on-site console has lost its connection to Ubiquiti's cloud service, or the service itself has an outage.", solution: "Check status.ui.com for outages. Ensure the console has a valid internet connection and DNS is working. In **Settings > System > Administration**, try disabling and re-enabling Remote Access." },
            { id: 18, product: 'UniFi', category: 'Controller', title: 'Statistics and Client Data are Missing', symptom: "Historical data for clients or traffic is gone.", cause: "Improper shutdown or database corruption.", solution: "Restore from the most recent automatic backup.
